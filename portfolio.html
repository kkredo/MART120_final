 <p>The second week of the class I got my first taste of coding. I have never coded
    before in my life so I was equally excited as I was anxious to begin the
    assignment. I completed the short coursework on One Hour of Code earning my
    Certificate of Completion as well as coding my own shape in the Artist Lab.
    This code consisted of drag and drop coding which I enjoyed because I was
    able to see the different options and functions that could be utilized.

This week the intensity of coding began to increase with the creation of the
Scratch game. The game I created is a pretty simple arcade style game in which
the two characters, the bears, move independently. Points are earned by
colliding with the car. Each bear has at least 3 costumes and the background
changes once a higher score is reached. My broadcasting in this piece is
shown in the very start of the game when the two bears speak to each other.
One of the bears is controlled with arrow keys while the other is
controlled by mouse clicks. This piece was fun to make,
but rather confusing and frustrating at times. I struggled with some of the variables and functions.

I really loved this assignment! The App portion was really fun and I really enjoyed creating my own interactive App. I created a decision making app in which the user chooses what the couple will do for their date night or day. Each screen gives the user an option to pick an activity shown or an option to do something else. If the user picks an activity shown, a screen saying “That sounds great!” will appear. If the user chooses to continue to other options, it will direct them to a new page of new options. I really struggled with the functions and creating the app pages at first, but once I got the hang of it, it was really easy and fun to use. The game portion of this assignment was not as fun for me. It was this week that I began to learn that I do not really enjoy making games. The game I made has two characters, the Dino and Octopus. The user can control the Dino with the arrow keys. The speed of this character randomly changes and will randomly shoot fire balls, while the octopus cannot be controlled. The octopus will move randomly and when the characters collide the octopus will say “Hey!”

This assignment was really not enjoyable for me. Not being a gamer, I did not find creating games to be fun. It is interesting to me however and I do now have a much greater appreciation for game makers and the painstaking work and detail that goes into them. In this game I have 5 characters, a bear cub, a bison, a horse, and two large bears. I made a simple story in which the bear cub is lost and the father bear is looking for him. The father bear asks each of the animals if they have seen his son. The camera moves to each animal and the bear moves with him. The bear cub and bear dad are handled with the keyboard and mouse clicks. At the end of the game the bison and bear dad “fight” and the collision causes the bears and the bison to move apart from each other. This was a great exposure to other types of code.

 <p>Working with HTML and the future web assignments were my favorite assignments in this class. I think it is super cool to code a web page and then actually be able to view it and use it. I made three HTML pages here, the first one contained different listing styles, the second a story and image and the last a contact page. It was really cool to incorporate my own interests and stories in an assignment. Creating and working with forms were tricky, but they are essential to any site so I was really happy to learn them. I am really interested in web design and utilizing these skills in my career so I found this week to be very fascinating. I learned that there are different ways to create lists and how to link pages together, creating a simple yet effective site.

 <p>A continuation of last week’s assignment, I learned how to implement inline styles in my work and CSS. I really have fallen in love with CSS and styling of HTML. Being able to learn how to use ID selectors, class selectors, and CDN made my site much more functional and user friendly. I used CSS to add a background image to page two. Bootstrap and CDN were a bit tricky to get working, but once I did, the site looked and worked much better. It felt like I could not get the Bootstrap to link properly, but after a while I got it.</p>

 <p>JavaScript has been an ongoing challenge for me. I could not figure out how to make the notices appear and the forms required. I was not sure what I was doing wrong. I got some elements to work, but it seemed like I would get one element to work and then that would mess up other functions that were fine before. The math game was a nightmare. I really struggled with that too. I was able to somewhat make the print out of the score and answers correct work, but not entirely. I learned that JavaScript is an essential component of any functional site, and I look forward to becoming better at it.</p>

<p>This week was a nice break after last week’s nightmare.  P5js is a neat platform and I enjoyed working with it and creating the simple shapes.  Basically the shapes created a crude image of a person and it was interesting to me how much input went into getting those shapes to appear. I am spoiled with Photoshop and Illustrator where creating an image like this would take a few minutes, but I enjoyed the challenge this week offered. </p>

<p>Continuing from last week I learned how to make my shapes move and change speeds through functions. I had two shapes move back and forth along the x axis and another two shapes along the y axis as well as a couple shapes moving diagonally. I struggled with making just my title element to change size, because both my name and title would change size. I tried a lot of different functions, but could not get it to work correctly. </p>

<p>This week I made a spore like game in which the player was controlled with the arrow keys and I created an exit. When the player hits the exit , “You Win” appears. I used if / statements and logical operators to create the elements in the game. I learned how to make a functional game that the user could control the player. I think it would be cool to incorporate score and have two players.

<p>This assignment was a challenge. I struggled with functions and had a hard time understanding how they worked. It always felt like I would get one element to work properly and then the rest would not be called. Professor Cassens was a great help and with him I was able to scrap together most of the assignment. I could not figure out how call the mouse-clicked function and my “You Win” function did not work ideally. I wanted it to only be called when the player collided with the exit, but it would run once the player would move.

<p>Arrays were a bit of a nightmare for me too. I could not wrap my head around how they worked, but with Professor Cassens’ help again, I was able to whip up a somewhat finished project. I experienced similar challenges again in this assignment with not being able to create a proper text array as well as my mouse click array. I could not get the shapes to move randomly, only change colors. I also struggled with the exit and making it appear. Overall the last few assignments were a challenge for me, but I learned a bit about how these games are created and the uses that these programs offer. Much respect and appreciation to those who excel at this.
